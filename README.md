# Aetherion Trading Engine

**Aetherion is a professional-grade, cloud-native platform for algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis.**

Aetherion empowers quantitative analysts, algorithmic traders, and fintech developers to design, backtest, and deploy sophisticated trading strategies with institutional-grade tools and real-time performance insights.

## Key Features

*   **High-Performance Trading:** Built with a polyglot architecture (Go, Rust, Python) for low-latency execution and robust performance.
*   **Real-Time Market Data:** Direct integration with live WebSocket feeds from major exchanges like Coinbase, providing tick-by-tick data.
*   **Advanced Risk Management:** A sophisticated risk engine built in Rust to provide real-time position tracking and (planned) advanced risk metrics like Value at Risk (VaR).
*   **Strategy Automation:** A powerful bot framework to automate your trading strategies, with support for custom algorithms.
*   **Modern, Intuitive UI:** A sleek and responsive React-based user interface for monitoring markets, managing bots, and visualizing performance.
*   **Secure and Scalable:** Architected for the cloud, with a secure JWT-based authentication system and a scalable microservices architecture.

## Getting Started

### For Traders & Quants

The easiest way to get started with Aetherion is to use our hosted cloud platform (coming soon). In the meantime, you can run the platform locally using Docker.

### For Developers

Aetherion is open-source and highly extensible. To run a local instance for development and testing:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rwh9609-bit/multilanguage.git
    cd multilanguage
    ```

2.  **Set up your environment:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Edit `.env` to set a strong `AUTH_SECRET`.*

3.  **Build and run with Docker:**
    ```bash
    make docker-build
    AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) docker compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    *   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
    *   **API (via Envoy):** `https://localhost:8080`

For more detailed instructions on setting up your development environment, see the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER.md).

## Architecture

Aetherion is built on a modern, microservices-based architecture:

*   **Frontend:** React
*   **Backend Services:** Go, Rust, Python
*   **API Gateway:** Envoy Proxy (with gRPC-Web)
*   **Communication:** gRPC

This polyglot approach allows us to use the best tool for each job, ensuring high performance, reliability, and scalability.
